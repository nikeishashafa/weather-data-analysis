# Weather Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical weather data to explore temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle / weatherHistory.csv
- Columns include: Formatted Date, Summary, Precip Type, Temperature (C), Apparent Temperature (C), Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km), Cloud Cover, Pressure (millibars), Daily Summary.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Steps
1. Extract and load dataset
2. Initial exploration (shape, columns, info, describe, missing values)
3. Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates)
4. Basic statistics (mean, min, max)
5. Categorical analysis (Precip Type distribution)
6. Visualization (histograms, bar chart, pie chart)
7. Optional: trends over time, feature correlation, additional visualizations

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells in order

## Insights
- Rain occurs more frequently than snow.  
- Average temperature trends higher in summer months.  
- Correlation exists between temperature and apparent temperature.
